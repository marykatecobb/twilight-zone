This assignment was a great real-life experience for working on a website with multiple people. We had several challenges when trying to navigate how to appropriately push the content to the main page. We were finally able to understand the correct steps from a GitHub article, as well as ask several questions to Efren. We also had some issues with formatting the site to mobile, but in the end, we were able to figure that out as well. We all worked on our own pages, and while Mary Kate took over the page from our previous group member, Renee, Maddy, and Lacey formatted the website for mobile devices to make sure that all had the same number of pushes.
