Despite their differences, Bella and Edward fall in love, but their relationship is fraught with danger, especially as Bella learns more about the world of vampires. Their romance is complicated further by a rival vampire clan that targets Bella, putting her life in peril. Edward and his family work together to protect her, but Bella remains drawn to the vampire world, even as it threatens her safety.
